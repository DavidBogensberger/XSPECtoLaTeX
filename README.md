# XSPECtoLaTeX
This code helps to convert an XSPEC output into a LaTeX format, by selecting the key information automatically, and outputting LaTeX equations

It is possible that the last significant figure of a number with decimal places is omitted by rounding. 

Check the results for inconsistencies or other errors, that might have been caused by a selection of parameters that were frozen or tied to other parameters. Parameter errors that cannot be constrained by XSPEC might also cause problems.
